# MailChimpNewsLetter
Live News letter using MailChimps API and running on a heroku server.
Originally the project was made on a local Express server using Node.js.
Once the newsletters main features were running I used the MailChimp developer API in paired with a Key to transfer the project to a Heroku server.

*** Newsletter does not send anything out***
